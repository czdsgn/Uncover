# Uncover

Self-awareness as a Service, a voice AI companion that helps you discover your true intentions and motivations through natural conversation.

üîó **Live Demo**: https://uncover-nine.vercel.app/

üí¨ **Conversation Video**: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17zz1KFHpV1bhEESIQnZrB2ogRKlbYsH4/view?usp=sharing

## What is Uncover?

Instead of fulfilling your surface-level desires, Uncover asks deeper questions to help you understand *why* you want what you want. Through 3-4 conversational exchanges, it guides you from "what you think you want" to "what you actually need."

- Traditional AI: "I want pizza" ‚Üí "Here are nearby pizza places"  
- Uncover: "I want pizza" ‚Üí "Are you actually hungry, or is something else going on?"

## Features

- **Voice-First Interface**: Natural speech-to-speech conversation
- **AI-Powered Questioning**: Uses GPT-4 to generate thoughtful, exploratory questions
- **Natural Voice Synthesis**: ElevenLabs integration for human-like responses
- **Intent Recognition**: Categorizes your thoughts (wanting, frustration, uncertainty, escape)
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Automatically switches to browser TTS if needed

## Example Conversations

You: I feel excited and proud that I finally build something that's working as I intended.

Uncover: That's wonderful to hear! What do you think this achievement means for you personally, beyond just the excitement of building something functional?

You: I built some confidence that I could actually build something and I have more capability to actually make my ideas into reality more and more. I have so many ideas that I want to make it real.

Uncover: It's great that you're feeling more confident! What do you think those ideas represent for you, and why are they important to bring to life?

You: I feel so motivated to make something.

Uncover: That motivation is a powerful driving force! What do you think it feels like for you to create something? Is there a specific emotion or sense of fulfillment tied to that process?

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**:
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Web Speech API (speech recognition)
- Responsive CSS

**Backend**:
- Node.js + Express
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration
- ElevenLabs TTS API
- RESTful API design

**Deployment**:
- Vercel (full-stack hosting)
- Automatic HTTPS

## AI Integration

- **Intent Classification**: Automatically detects emotional patterns (wanting, frustrated, uncertain, escape)
- **Dynamic Prompting**: Adapts conversation style based on user's psychological state
- **Turn Management**: Provides insights after 3-4 exchanges to synthesize discoveries
- **Fallback Responses**: Graceful handling when APIs are unavailable

## Design Principle

Uncover focuses on helping humans understand themselves better rather than just executing tasks. The minimalist voice interface removes barriers to authentic expression and encourages genuine reflection.
